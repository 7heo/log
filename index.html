<p><em>2013/11/09 - 0300 GMT+1</em></p>

<p>Recently, I've witnessed the (pathetic?) efforts that Microsoft does to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2013/05/28/discussing-microsoft-s-openness-at-linux-tag.aspx">improve their image</a>, to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5953866/microsoft-surface-rt-review-this-is-technological-heartbreak">innovate</a>, and so on. I've more or less always been forced to use Microsoft's products, would it even only be for their dominance over the PC gaming market. As a result, when I want to quickly prototype application idea, I sometimes use C#.</p>

<p>And today, I just had the worst experience I ever had with an IDE for my entire life. With Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express, to be precise. What happened is that I created a new project, coded a bit, and when I was satisfied with my work, after one hour or so; I did leave the IDE open in order to surf a bit, and quickly got back at it. Needless to say, I'm used to save my work, and I pressed [Ctrl] + [s] every five minute or so; while I was coding.</p>

<p>When I got back at the IDE, it had a modal dialog in front of it, asking me for a registration key. As I'm not a big fan of the compulsory identification practices that spread like the pest, I clicked on cancel, <strong>exactly the same way I did when I opened the IDE</strong>, hoping to return to my work. But, unlike when the IDE opened, this time, it did close without a warning, without giving me a chance to save the project (which I thought was saved, as I had used [CTRL] + [s] extensively).</p>

<p>Bottom line: Now I have got a key for the IDE, I don't risk anymore (afaik) to lose some data because of some very bad design choice, dictated by an overly stupid marketing decision, very probably made by an even more stupid employee of a greedy monopolistic company that accumulates law infringements faster than Google gathers people's data. This is just to say: Microsoft, take a good look at us, while you still can. Take a good look at what people think of you when you treat them like retards. When you don't give a f*ck about interoperability and consider yourself the only important thing on Earth. And watch us switch to other systems and software. You won't ever change. We know that. It's only a matter of time before your name won't be anywhere but on Wikipedia. So, enjoy your wealth while you still can. And then, please, die silently.</p>

<p>As it is really simple to generate a website with github, I'm starting a log here. More to come, probably.</p>
